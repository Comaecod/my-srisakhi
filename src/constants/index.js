        September clouds wept sweet nectar as we stood on the terrace,
        <br />
        No grand displays, just your simple, pious grace in the mist. 🌧️
        <br />
        The guitar hummed, and my melodies found their true home,
        <br />
        In the quiet rhythm of your heart, our souls began to roam.
        <br />
        I didn&apos;t just find a partner; I found my eternal Sakhi,
        <br />A melody born in the rain, destined for the divine. 🪕

        Under the word of Kanchi Periyava, our destinies were sealed,
        <br />
        Five days of Agni, mantras, and a truth finally revealed. 🔥
        <br />
        October 24th wasn&apos;t just a wedding; it was a Sanatana vow,
        <br />
        To walk the path of Dharma, then, forever, and now.
        <br />
        In every ritual, I saw the reflection of Sri and Vishnu,
        <br />A union not of convenience, but of a thousand births. 📿

        When the road was harsh and my strength began to fray,
        <br />
        You became the medicine that kept the darkness at bay. 🩹
        <br />
        With a broken thumb and a heavy heart, I felt your healing hand,
        <br />
        You bathed me with a love that only the selfless can understand.
        <br />
        In your care, I saw the strength of a goddess, soft yet bold,
        <br />A devotion more precious than the finest temple gold. ✨

        December brought a miracle, a heartbeat small and new,
        <br />
        A gift from Venkateshwara, a blend of me and you. 🪷
        <br />
        From the heights of Sringeri to the gates of Kanchipuram,
        <br />
        We sought the Gurus&apos; blessings for the life yet to come.
        <br />
        With gold and sacred milk, we blessed our child&apos;s first home,
        <br />
        Growing strong in your womb, beneath the cosmic dome. 👣

        I see you battling the dawn, the sickness, and the strain,
        <br />
        Yet you smile through the struggle, ignoring the quiet pain. 🌸
        <br />
        You are staying strong for our little one, my brave sweetheart,
        <br />
        While I stand as your rock, never to be apart.
        <br />
        Lean on me, Radha, when the waves of pain rise,
        <br />I am your shelter, your protector, under these vast skies. 💪

        Love isn&apos;t in the grand gestures, but in the things we share,
        <br />
        In the starry walks and the silence that shows we care. 🌌
        <br />
        Cooking together, watching films, or just holding your hand,
        <br />
        Building our kingdom on this ancient, righteous land.
        <br />
        Everything I earn is ours; every dream I chase is for us,
        <br />A life lived in dignity, without inhibitions or fuss. 🥘

        <br />
        Guided by the stars that watched us on that first rainy night.
        <br />
        I promise to be the anchor, the shield, and the steady hand,
        <br />
        Leading our family across life’s shifting sand.
        <br />
        Our Dharmic journey continues, deeper than the sea,

        Bound by ancient mantras, for all eternity. 🕉️
